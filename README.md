# work in progress

In trying to get the authorizer to work with serverless express, i took a different tack and tried using the docker lambda web adapter instead of vendia serverless express - for the image service. It appeared to work but it wasn't tested very thoroughly and is probably full of holes. However, i left the code here to come back to later as I wanted to get vendia serverless express working.

See repo 125 where serverless express works.
